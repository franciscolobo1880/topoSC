The code foundations are written within the package Quantica.jl. The folder /src/builders contains all lattice and Hamiltonian builds of various theorical models, namely:
        - Kitaev chain
        - SSH chain
        - Oreg-Lutchyn nanowire
        - Monolayer graphene
        - Bilayer graphene

Visualize the lattices, bandstructures, spectrums, ettc... of various the models on their respective .jl files. See that at the end of each file there are functions that generate the pretty plots.
